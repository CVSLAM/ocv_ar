*INKA Research Group / Project MINERVA, HTW Berlin - http://inka.htw-berlin.de/inka/projekte/minerva/*

This project implements a simple but powerful Augmented Reality solution based on [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). It is based on the explainations from the book *Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects* (Baggio et al., 2012) and borrows some ideas and code from [ArUco](http://sourceforge.net/projects/aruco/). It is written in C++ and has no dependencies besides the already mentioned OpenCV.

The project is still at an early stage and further documentation and usage examples will be added soon.

## TODO

* smoothing
* improve performance
* further documentation
* usage examples (extra projects)
